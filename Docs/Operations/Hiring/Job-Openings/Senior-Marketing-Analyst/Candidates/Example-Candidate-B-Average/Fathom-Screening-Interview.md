## Company Introduction & Role Overview

**Jennifer Clark:** Hi Michael! Thanks for joining us today. Let me start by explaining our role and company structure.

We're a marketing analytics consultancy working primarily with US clients who have substantial digital advertising budgets. Our analysts work closely with project managers to build and maintain automated reporting systems.

The technical focus is quite strong - about 80% SQL and data engineering work, 20% Power BI visualization. Does this align with your expectations?

**Michael Thompson:** Yes, that sounds interesting. I'm actually looking to move more into the technical side. Right now I use mostly Python and Pandas, but I'd like to develop stronger SQL and data engineering skills.

## Technical Experience Discussion

**Jennifer Clark:** That's good to hear. Can you walk me through your current technical stack and responsibilities?

**Michael Thompson:** Sure. At JewelCorp, I primarily work with Python in Google Colab. I built an automated monthly reporting system that processes CRM exports and generates multi-sheet reports in Google Sheets.

I also maintain a Power BI dashboard for management. The challenge is that we don't have a proper data warehouse yet - I'm mostly working with Excel exports from our 1C system.

**Jennifer Clark:** Interesting. What about SQL experience specifically?

**Michael Thompson:** I studied SQL and completed some online courses, but honestly I don't use it daily at work. My current role is more Python-heavy since we don't have database infrastructure. I'd rate myself as intermediate in SQL knowledge but limited in production experience.

**Jennifer Clark:** That's honest feedback. What about API integrations?

**Michael Thompson:** That's actually something I want to learn. Right now I manually export data from Facebook Ads Manager, but I know there are APIs for that. I'm planning to take some courses on API integration and data engineering.

## Motivation & Career Goals

**Jennifer Clark:** What's motivating you to look for a new opportunity?

**Michael Thompson:** I want to work in a more technical environment with experienced data engineers. In my current role, I'm the only analyst, so there's limited learning opportunities.

I'm particularly interested in automation and building proper data pipelines rather than just doing analysis on static exports.

**Jennifer Clark:** Where do you see yourself in 2-3 years?

**Michael Thompson:** I'd like to transition fully into data engineering while maintaining the marketing domain knowledge. Eventually becoming a technical lead who can bridge the gap between business requirements and technical implementation.

## Practical Considerations

**Jennifer Clark:** Our team works across different time zones. We have morning meetings US time, which would be afternoon for you. Some client calls might be in the evening your time. How does that sound?

**Michael Thompson:** That should work fine. I'm flexible with hours and actually prefer some later meetings since I'm more productive in the afternoons.

**Jennifer Clark:** And you mentioned you're open to relocation?

**Michael Thompson:** Yes, I'm quite flexible. I'm considering several European countries, particularly looking at tax-friendly options like Georgia or Portugal.

**Jennifer Clark:** What about salary expectations?

**Michael Thompson:** I'm looking for around $2,500-3,000 monthly, depending on location and growth opportunities. I understand this might be on the lower end given my current experience level.

## Areas of Concern

**Jennifer Clark:** I want to be transparent about some potential challenges. Our role requires strong SQL skills from day one, and you mentioned limited production experience.

**Michael Thompson:** I appreciate the honesty. I'm confident I can learn quickly, and I have the foundational knowledge. I'm actually excited about the opportunity to work with real database systems instead of spreadsheet exports.

**Jennifer Clark:** Also, we work with various APIs and data sources. Would you be comfortable learning these on the job?

**Michael Thompson:** Absolutely. That's exactly what I'm looking for - hands-on learning with proper mentorship.

## Next Steps

**Jennifer Clark:** Thanks Michael. Your motivation and learning attitude are clear positives. The main question is whether your current technical level aligns with our immediate needs.

We'll discuss internally and get back to you about next steps. If we proceed, it would be a technical interview focusing on SQL and problem-solving.

**Michael Thompson:** That sounds fair. I'm ready to demonstrate what I can do and honest about areas where I need to grow.
