# Scoring Framework

*This is a template example. Adjust scoring criteria based on your company's role requirements and evaluation standards.*

## Evaluation Scale:

- **5 — Expert Level**: Candidate demonstrates deep knowledge and consistent practical experience, capable of teaching others
- **4 — Strong Level**: Candidate confidently possesses required skills, capable of independently solving tasks
- **3 — Meets Expectations**: Basic required competency level for task execution
- **2 — Partially Meets**: Limited experience, requires additional training or support
- **1 — Weak**: Practically no relevant experience or skills in this competency

## General Evaluation Rules:

- Each competency is evaluated separately
- Evaluation based on all available sources: CV, Interview Transcripts, AI Notes, Evaluations
- When data is insufficient, competency marked as "Insufficient Data"
- Overall final fit calculated according to individual Scoring Rules for each specific position
- Evaluation has expert-analytical nature: must consider both direct competency confirmations and context (e.g., task complexity, company size, independence level)
