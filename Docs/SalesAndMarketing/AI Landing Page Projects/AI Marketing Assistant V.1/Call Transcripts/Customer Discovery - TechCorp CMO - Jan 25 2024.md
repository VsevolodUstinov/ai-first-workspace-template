## Call Notes

**Mike**: "Tell me about how you currently monitor your advertising performance."

**Jennifer**: "Honestly? It's mostly reactive. We get reports weekly, and by the time we notice something's wrong, we've already wasted weeks of budget. Last quarter we had a LinkedIn campaign that stopped converting but kept spending. Took us 3 weeks to catch it - cost us $40K."

**Mike**: "What would ideal look like?"

**Jennifer**: "I want to know the same day something breaks. Better yet, I want to know about opportunities I'm missing. Like if there's a segment performing well that we should double down on, or budget limits holding back good campaigns."

**Mike**: "How would you value a system that could give you those insights weekly?"

**Jennifer**: "If it saved us even one mistake like that LinkedIn campaign per quarter, it would pay for itself many times over. The opportunity cost of missed optimizations is probably even bigger."

**Mike**: "What would make you trust AI recommendations?"

**Jennifer**: "I need to understand the 'why' behind every suggestion. Don't just tell me to increase budget - show me the data, the logic, the expected outcome. I need to be able to explain it to my CEO."

### Pain Points Identified
1. **Delayed Problem Detection**: 2-3 week lag between issues and discovery
2. **Manual Analysis**: Time-intensive weekly report reviews
3. **Opportunity Blindness**: Missing growth opportunities in good-performing segments
4. **Lack of Confidence**: Hard to know when to make big budget changes

### Feature Validation
- ✅ **Automated Alerts**: "Yes, I need immediate notification of problems"
- ✅ **Explainable Insights**: "Must understand the reasoning behind recommendations"
- ✅ **ROI Calculations**: "Need clear financial impact estimates"
- ✅ **Weekly Cadence**: "Weekly insights would be perfect rhythm"

### Pricing Feedback
- **Budget Range**: $8K-12K/month acceptable for clear ROI
- **ROI Expectation**: Must save 2-3x the cost in first quarter
- **Decision Process**: Would need CEO approval for $10K+ monthly spend
