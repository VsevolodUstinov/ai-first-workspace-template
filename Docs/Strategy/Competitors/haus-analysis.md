Notable customers include Intuit, Sonos, AG1, Dr. Squatch, and Caraway. They differentiate through privacy-proof measurement, automated geo experiments, and scientific rigor.

**Market Position:** Leading incrementality-first platform in US market, strong with DTC brands. Positioned as modern alternative to traditional attribution platforms, addressing post-iOS 14 measurement challenges. Three-product approach (GeoLift, Causal Attribution, Causal MMM) provides incrementality at different scales.

**Competitive Threat:** [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW depending on your positioning]
- **HIGH** if you target DTC e-commerce incrementality/MMM market in US
- **MEDIUM** if you target e-commerce but different segment (SMB, different methodology)
- **LOW** if you focus on different verticals (lead gen, B2B, services, non-e-commerce)

**Key Takeaway:** Haus validates market shift from correlational attribution to causal incrementality measurement. Their privacy-first positioning, automated experimentation, and scientific rigor resonate with sophisticated DTC brands. The 4-year company already serving notable enterprise customers (Intuit) indicates strong product-market fit.
