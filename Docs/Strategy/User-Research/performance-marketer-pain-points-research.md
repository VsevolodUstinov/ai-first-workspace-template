**Collection Guidelines**:
- Capture everything relevant, even if it seems minor
- Include context about the source and their situation
- Don't filter or structure yet - just collect raw material
- Look for specific examples and quantified time impacts
- Note emotional language that indicates high frustration
- Document current workarounds and partial solutions
- Pay attention to cross-platform and integration challenges

**Target**: Collect 100+ distinct pain points/time sinks before beginning structured analysis
