## Meeting Start - Social Discussion

**Manager 1:** Before my departure, every week I meet with my guys, we play D&D, and, anyway, we play D&D with our local company, that is, I have here really a hodgepodge, I have, like, Russian, Tajik and one Serbian guy, and this Serbian guy... it was very hot, plus he's 49, and he was a bit worried about it. We played with him in the house, and yesterday on the street it was 37. It was a very hot game.

**Developer 1:** Like in the Tarantino joke from "From Dusk Till Dawn". This is a social experiment, he apparently had cameras set up. How long will these sick people last, like, sitting in a sauna for 4 hours? We're paying money for this, by the way.

**Analyst 1:** Very good. This can be used as experience for [Name], but they still couldn't sign the NDA.

## Review of Client-Logistics

**Project Manager 1:** Let's start. If you don't mind, I'll quickly run through Client-Logistics, Client-Beauty1 and Client-Beauty2. Actually, there's not much to discuss here, except for Client-Logistics, just to bring everyone up to speed.

**Analyst 1:** For Client-Logistics, we've basically closed all tasks, except for two. These are tasks from [Name], still remaining, medium priority. This is SEO report and geo for Google Ads.

**Manager 1:** Can you break them out as separate items?

**Analyst 1:** I can. Look, [Name] did SEO, I already looked. Geo needs to be coded a bit. That's all that remains from this task. Actually, I think it will close during this sprint.

**Developer 1:** Yes-yes-yes, there's not terribly much there. Most of the troubles with the geo report have already been passed.

## Discussion of Client-Logistics Priorities

**Team Lead 1:** From post-defense tasks, we have a Telegram notifier. But I'd put it at normal priority for now, because it's quite specific. And we have first click, because there was an error in attribution, and it broke. So we need to fix this.

**Manager 1:** No-no-no, don't. This isn't first necessity and attribution. It's sold, like the client pays 100% for something needed, but definitely not critical. It doesn't limit him from using the report.

**Analyst 1:** Did we communicate to the client that his attribution isn't working?

**Project Manager 1:** Listen, I actually wanted to and would be happy to show him, but our meeting moved to Tuesday now. We didn't have it on Thursday.

**Manager 1:** He won't make conclusions based on first-click, because [Name] is right, he really uses and used mainly last-click, that is, what we showed him.

## Client-Beauty1 - Technical Problems

**Developer 1:** [Name] and [Name], did the blogger attribution, this promo code one, get fixed?

**Analyst 1:** Yes. Fixed, meaning?

**Team Lead 1:** Can we look at it, let's leave five minutes, just want to understand. If you discussed everything else.

**Developer 1:** From what we did, we clarified with the guys whether they definitely didn't add anyone new in July. Now I updated right in the chat. I requested a list of bloggers, she writes the same list of bloggers for July and throws it.

**Analyst 1:** We need to remind them again to switch their expenses to specific ones.

**Manager 1:** Let's be more specific, how can we best remind them about this?

**Developer 1:** Well, they had separation into Instagram influencers before, some other influencers. UGC, yes. Here. We changed to specific people and linked each specific influencer to their promo code. But expenses in manual expenses remained in the same categories.

## Discussion of Client-Beauty2

**Project Manager 1:** Client-Beauty2 is all stable and calm now. He hasn't been aggressive for several weeks and pays. They paid for two months at once.

**Analyst 1:** Look, with [Name], like, no matter how we pleased him, we still couldn't make him calm down. You came, and you, anyway, charmed him with some feature.

**Manager 1:** [Name], you wrote added tests. Can we close tasks or not?

**Developer 1:** No, there need to be small fixes to the tests themselves not from my side, and when they're done, I'll make sure I definitely added everything needed, and mark it in the file, and that's it, and then it will be closed. But basically the tests already work mostly.

## Client-Food - Reporting Problems

**Team Lead 1:** About Client-Food, we have one and a half tasks remaining in work. I basically adjusted the click, updated by dates. What are we waiting for now? Today is the deadline for implementing changes on their side.

**Developer 2:** How is their process built now? Their process is built like this. Checkout page, next page is the payment system and then ThankYouPage. After our call last week they're redoing the flow.

**Analyst 1:** Accordingly, this means that ideally our external view of orders in the system will change. That is, it will be like on Client-Logistics. [Name] showed us an example of what will happen with orders when switching to native form.

## Discussion of Client-EdTech

**Manager 1:** About Client-EdTech, anyway, look, what we're talking about. We should have added all the same guys as on other projects.

**Developer 1:** I tried to add it. Is there a possibility to copy it? Look, I go into the system, press add, I don't have such a thing. I enter the code. Anyway, I spent several hours with this thing.

**Team Lead 1:** Look, there's, for example, [Name] here, yes, who's always happy to help everyone. There's [Name], who should always help everyone too, there are tons of analysts who work in our company, each of them will be happy to help you.

## Communication and Process Questions

**Project Manager 1:** Why can't you write to me? Do you know my Telegram? Like, why this pain and suffering? Like, for what?

**Developer 1:** This is a rhetorical question. I understand.

**Team Lead 1:** Look, it's absolutely normal that you, as a new employee, don't do some things quickly or, basically, don't know how to do them quickly. You have a senior for this, [Name]. And if the senior is on vacation, there's an analysts chat.

**Manager 1:** Nobody will look at you sideways. Like, all the guys. Nobody will get angry that you ping a whole group with some question, even if it's basic.

## Discussion of Client-Logistics (Additional Project)

**Analyst 1:** Let's proceed from this then. Look, anyway, everything we discussed today is doable by Wednesday for sure, except for one thing, about the number of sessions in advertising sources.

**Developer 1:** In advertising sources we have about 50% more sessions than in GA. That is, we have 2500 clicks from advertising systems and 1800 sessions, total of all, even with referrals, direct and so on.

**Manager 1:** So we 100% have some under-receiving of sessions, we need to quickly figure this out.

## Time and Resource Analysis

**Project Manager 1:** Next week, provided the client doesn't write anything in chat, nothing needs to be done, and the report doesn't fall once, we'll already run out of these 8 hours.

**Analyst 1:** We count them too, right? Meetings also go into time?

**Manager 1:** Of course. Meetings also go into time? Yes. Both managerial and analytical. Everything.

**Team Lead 1:** 3 hours, 4 weeks, that's 12 hours, plus external ones where at least 2 people go, they go for an hour each, that's another 8 hours, hello, 20 hours.

## Discussion of Process Optimization

**Developer 1:** Here's the thing, you know, [Name], what bothers me more is that I'll completely lose understanding of what's happening there. And yes, if here I can still hear something out of the corner of my ear, like, redirect the vector, for example, something else, yes, then like there won't be any at all.

**Manager 1:** We won't have any points of contact then, that is, we used to have like sprints, remember, where everyone gathered, yes, then split into teams, and if we split further, I think we need to do something about defining these project hours in general.

**Project Manager 1:** Let's think about where you can really be removed, or with what frequency you can come here, maybe just not every week conditionally.

## Meeting End

**Analyst 1:** Anyway, honestly, I wouldn't remove it. Well, like, if we're talking about this being related to client stability and their payment capacity, then, well, here, I don't know, we need a decision from you.

**Team Lead 1:** Anyway, if we're going to be afraid all our lives that the client will leave and spend a million hours to keep them, we just won't develop.

**Manager 1:** Let's try. Let's try without analysts. It worked for us on other projects, and other clients are also extremely demanding, guys. Let's try, if it suddenly becomes critical, we'll return it, but basically, I suggest considering that we can try.

**Everyone:** That's it, we're implementing. We can implement starting this week. That's it, thanks everyone.
