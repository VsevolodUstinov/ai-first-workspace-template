# AI First Workspace Template

## 🤔 Two Questions That Will Transform Your Business

**❓ What if you moved your workflows from ChatGPT's website to superagents like Cursor?**
- Instead of copying & pasting between browser tabs, your AI understands your entire business context
- No more losing conversation history or starting from scratch every session
- AI that knows your company's strategies, processes, and goals

**❓ What if your entire company used tools like Cursor and shared context, prompts, scripts, and workflows across the whole organization?**
- Your marketing team's AI expertise becomes available to your strategy team
- Your operations workflows become templates for the entire company  
- Every team member benefits from the collective AI intelligence of your organization

## 🎯 From Individual AI Usage → Organizational AI Intelligence

**Most companies today:** Everyone uses ChatGPT individually, recreating prompts, losing context, working in silos.

**What this template enables:** Your entire organization becomes an AI-powered organism where knowledge, workflows, and expertise compound across all departments.

git clone https://github.com/vsevolodustinov/ai-first-workspace-template.git
cd ai-first-workspace-template

# 2. Create your company's GitHub organization (if not exists)
# Go to https://github.com/organizations/new

# 3. Create separate repositories for each department:
```

#### 2. Required Repositories
Create these repositories in your organization:

- `[YourOrg]/Presales` - Presales materials & proposals

**Main Workspace Repo:**
- `[YourOrg]/SharedWorkspace` - This template, customized for your company

> **💡 Naming Your Main Workspace Repository:**
> 
> You can choose any name for your main workspace repository. **Recommended: `SharedWorkspace`**
> 
> - **`SharedWorkspace`** - Short, practical name for daily use
> - **`[YourCompany]-Workspace`** - Include your company name
> - **`AI-Workspace`** - Emphasize the AI-first approach
> 
> The name you choose here will be used in git clone commands and daily workflows, so pick something convenient for your team.

#### 3. Repository Setup Commands
```bash
# Replace [YourOrg] with your GitHub organization name
# Replace [YourCompany] with your company name

# Create and initialize each repository:
gh repo create [YourOrg]/Strategy --private
gh repo create [YourOrg]/Product --private  
gh repo create [YourOrg]/SalesAndMarketing --private
gh repo create [YourOrg]/Operations --private
gh repo create [YourOrg]/Operations-Hiring --private
gh repo create [YourOrg]/Finance --private
gh repo create [YourOrg]/Legal-HR --private
gh repo create [YourOrg]/Dev-[ProductName] --private
gh repo create [YourOrg]/Projects --private
gh repo create [YourOrg]/Presales --private
gh repo create [YourOrg]/SharedWorkspace --private

# Clone and populate template content:
git clone git@github.com:[YourOrg]/SharedWorkspace.git
cd SharedWorkspace

# Copy template content to each repository
# (Detailed instructions in setup/ folder)
```

### Phase 2: Content Customization

#### 1. Update Workspace Configuration
```bash
# Edit .cursorrules to replace [COMPANY_NAME] with your company
# Edit setup scripts to point to your repositories
# Update README.md with your company information

# IMPORTANT: Set up .gitignore for your workspace
cp .gitignore.template .gitignore
# This file excludes department repos (Docs/, Dev/, etc.) since they're separate git repositories
```

#### 2. Populate Department Repositories
```bash
# For each department, copy relevant template content:
cd Docs/Strategy
# Copy strategy templates and examples
# Replace Elly Analytics examples with your company information

cd ../Product  
# Copy product templates and examples
# Adapt to your product architecture

# Repeat for all departments...
```

#### 3. Team Onboarding
```bash
# Add team members to appropriate repositories
# Set up department-specific permissions
# Train teams on AI context switching
```

### Phase 3: Tool Migration

#### 1. Cursor Setup for Teams
```bash
# Install Cursor for all team members
# Import workspace configuration
# Train on AI context switching commands
```

#### 2. Workflow Training
- **Department heads** - Learn context switching and AI workflows
- **Team members** - Daily workflow patterns and AI collaboration  
- **Leadership** - Cross-department visibility and strategic AI use

#### 3. Gradual Migration
1. **Week 1-2**: Department heads set up repositories and learn workflows
2. **Week 3-4**: Migrate existing documentation to new structure
3. **Week 5-6**: Train team members on AI-first workflows
4. **Week 7+**: Full adoption and optimization
