**Manager 1:** Obviously, nothing improved from Friday to Monday. I pinged Client-Logistics because over the weekend not only trades didn't come (which were zero all last week anyway), but also it seems like deposits didn't come.

**Analyst 1:** But two days might not be that scary, because they already had such gaps when nothing was coming. But it's questionable, considering that their current data keeps disappearing anyway.

**Manager 1:** Deposits and not a single trading account. There was one trader account. This could be true, of course. When? The 17th?

**Developer 1:** The 17th, yes. From the 19th. I don't have it in my table. Let me check.

**Manager 1:** On the 18th? Yes, look at today even. 16th, 16th? Wait, I'm looking at GRO meanwhile.

**Analyst 1:** I don't know, listen, we need to check, because look in the report data by yesterday, it seems like the 19th and 18th were also coming. And this is in GROSS.

**Developer 1:** So, moving on to the tasks. Anyway, with time zones [Name] also, obviously, didn't get back. I'll wait for client feedback on this issue.

**Manager 2:** Here, and it seems like this isn't a hot task, because we align with their DB, but don't align with the CRM, well, with the SugarCRM interface.

**Developer 1:** Further, they seem to have really configured this thing, like accounts, stuffed all their domains into Google Analytics. I need to assign myself a task to check how cross-domain tracking works between all this stuff now.

**Manager 1:** And then let's go through all the advertising stories. Anyway, he hasn't given us access and doesn't seem to be planning to do this anytime soon. I don't know why.

**Analyst 1:** [Name], just keeping you informed. Anyway, they periodically cut this advertising, sometimes they launch LinkedIn, then remove it, sometimes they launch Google Ads normally, but this is what they're installing on it now, what we need.

**Developer 2:** Like, cross-domain, Google Client ID and so on, this is like a working version. But they're apparently just launching this whole process now.

**Manager 1:** They're in the process of launching seemingly, but they're driving some incomprehensible stuff, not to this landing page, some pennies on a partner account that they can't share.

**Analyst 1:** Because he's still not a business manager, and they're warming up a eurotrader from some personal partner account. Is this just working as brand awareness for them now?

**Developer 1:** So there are no links from them to transition to the EU even? Well, you see, their landing page isn't even written normally yet.

**Manager 2:** Where do they lead, I never understood. Just somewhere? We didn't understand either. To some block or what is this? I think I'm confused here already.

**Manager 1:** Let me clarify with [Name] once more what they're leading to on Facebook. Because he said initially that they would lead to a partner landing page, but they haven't finished the landing page yet, can't send us the link.

**Developer 1:** And these things are still stopping everything. Anyway, there's no launched landing page on live. In normal, yes, there's no normal version. But I'll go and clarify once more.

**Analyst 1:** I don't like that they can't give us access in any way, but meanwhile [Name] already said to the latest requests for access that he'll provide access as soon as possible.

**Manager 1:** That's the position. But you saw the traffic in general, well, the quantity, so there really isn't a super critical situation yet that we don't have access to what leads like two clicks to the site.

**Developer 2:** The problem here is that tomorrow there might be more of them, theoretically, and we won't have access, they'll all start falling into unknown, causing questions and...

**Manager 2:** Let's be more positive. Client-Beauty1 numbers, for example. Excellent. Actually in Google Analytics they're even less.

**Analyst 1:** Well, that's expected. Much less or a little less? Much less, actually. What surprises me, I'll look now if this is the 15th or not, but it seems like these two numbers just stand out strongly.

**Developer 1:** Because here for just 5-6 days there are 1700 sessions, but we should have that much for just one day. Yeah. And we have one counter pulling? There were various eurotraders and such.

**Manager 1:** Ah, you know what? Wait. I'm something, yes, that one. Yes, one counter is pulling. Did they substitute three times or what? What, did this propeller cheat again?

**Developer 2:** Well, let me just look at what got cheated on the 15th. We can look at some other one, such a shifted seven.

**Analyst 1:** Okay, I suggest we stop suggesting to me how, there are problems, we need to look at what's wrong with it. In VQ I can just look at dynamics, like ratios, if there are 15, 16, 17, 18, like they relate in proportion by quantity.

**Manager 2:** Well anyway, let's at least review the blackish one, okay? How different is it? Come on, good.

**Developer 1:** Can you, [Name], please write this task as detailed as you can? Well, from your side. I'll ask [Name] to do it just right.

**Manager 1:** Okay, we'll figure out this task in detail in Slack. I'll write it out, but you never know if help will still be needed. Don't you want to quickly figure it out with [Name] right now?

**Developer 2:** Look, specifically the access conditionally there to accesses, to email in order to compare this story, I'll definitely attach, access to accounting too, but then you'll need to issue tables, okay?

**Analyst 1:** No, I won't abandon it, of course, yes, I'm saying, write from your side as much as you can, and I'll do the rest like that.

**Manager 1:** And look, [Name], I'm just highlighting for you, nothing has changed with partners. I'll tag sequentially, well like one task at a time.

**Developer 1:** I tagged him about trades and, in general, all silver data except partners, but partners also haven't changed. It's strange about them, very little gets attributed, even in partner attribution.

**Analyst 1:** Throughout all of July. Super strange, for me. Such a number of 4 thousand out of 123, although they don't have any real advertising sources now.

**Manager 2:** And like everything happily fell into SEO and Direct. But it's small and nice, of course, but this isn't very good. Anyway, Client-Logistics is also pinging for now.

**Developer 1:** No, there are two problems now. Marketing is still on [Name], well that's another question, and on Client-Logistics indeed what happened is that their equal data has some issue again now.

**Manager 1:** Well, yes. This isn't the first time this has happened when people don't have a test environment, don't have anything like that, it always turns out like this approximately. So there's nothing surprising about it.
