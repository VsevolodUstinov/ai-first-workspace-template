## Transcript (Key Highlights)

**Sarah**: "What if instead of just answering questions, our AI proactively identifies problems? Like, 'Hey, you're wasting $23K on this Facebook campaign that stopped working 3 days ago.'"

**Mike**: "That's exactly what our prospects are asking for. They want to catch problems before they become expensive mistakes."

**Lisa**: "We need clear examples. Like: 'AI caught a underperforming campaign after 2 days instead of 2 weeks, saving $15K in wasted spend.'"

**Sarah**: "And growth opportunities too. 'This Google campaign has great conversion rates but hit budget limits. Remove limits for an estimated $10K additional weekly revenue.'"

**Mike**: "The key is explainable insights. Not just 'do this' but 'here's why, here's the expected impact, here's how we calculated it.'"

**Lisa**: "For the landing page, we should lead with the money-saving examples. That gets attention immediately."

### Next Steps Agreed
- Focus V.1 landing page on cost savings and growth identification
- Develop 3-5 specific insight examples for the page
- Target mid-market companies with significant ad spend
- Position as premium solution with high-touch onboarding
