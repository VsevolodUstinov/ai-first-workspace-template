# Project Status (Working Documents)

- Store current project status cards used in demos here.
- After each demo, manually rollback the card to template.
- Mandatory anonymization: names → segments, numbers → depersonalized, don't publish negative statuses.

Rollback:
1) Save demo artifacts (copy if needed)
2) Replace card content with template
