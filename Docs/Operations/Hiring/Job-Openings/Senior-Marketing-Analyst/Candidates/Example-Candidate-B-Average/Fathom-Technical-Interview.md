## Technical Assessment: SQL Skills

**David Martinez:** Hi Michael, thanks for joining us for the technical round. We'll be testing your SQL skills with some practical scenarios similar to what you'd encounter in our daily work.

Let me share my screen with our test database. We have four tables: companies, passengers, passenger_trips, and trips. Can you see the schema?

**Michael Thompson:** Yes, I can see it. Looks like a flight booking system.

**David Martinez:** Exactly. Let's start with something straightforward. Can you write a query to find all companies that had more than 5 flights in May 2024?

**Michael Thompson:** Sure, let me think about this... I need to join trips with companies and filter by date.

```sql
SELECT c.company_name, COUNT(t.trip_id) as flight_count
FROM companies c
JOIN trips t ON c.company_id = t.company_id  
WHERE t.departure_time >= '2024-05-01' 
  AND t.departure_time < '2024-06-01'
GROUP BY c.company_name
HAVING COUNT(t.trip_id) > 5;
```

**David Martinez:** Good approach. One small note - you might want to specify the GROUP BY with company_id as well for better practice, but this works. 

Now, let's make it more challenging. Can you find passengers who have taken exactly 3 or more flights with the same company, and list those passengers with their company?

**Michael Thompson:** Hmm, this is more complex. I need to... let me see...

```sql
SELECT p.passenger_name, c.company_name, COUNT(*) as trips_count
FROM passengers p
JOIN passenger_trips pt ON p.passenger_id = pt.passenger_id
JOIN trips t ON pt.trip_id = t.trip_id  
JOIN companies c ON t.company_id = c.company_id
GROUP BY p.passenger_id, c.company_id
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3;
```

**Amanda Rodriguez:** That's on the right track. You're correctly joining all the tables. However, you're grouping by passenger_id and company_id but selecting passenger_name and company_name. What issue might this cause?

**Michael Thompson:** Oh, right... I should include the IDs in the GROUP BY or use the IDs in the SELECT. In some databases this would cause an error.

**Amanda Rodriguez:** Exactly. Let's fix that. Also, I notice you used COUNT(*) - is that the best choice here?

**Michael Thompson:** I could use COUNT(pt.trip_id) to be more explicit, though COUNT(*) should work fine since we're joining on non-null values.

**David Martinez:** Let's move to a more challenging scenario. We want to analyze the most popular aircraft for each company. Can you write a query that shows each company with their most frequently used aircraft type, along with the count of flights for that aircraft?

**Michael Thompson:** This is getting tricky... I need to find the max count per company. Let me try using a window function...

```sql
SELECT company_name, aircraft_type, flight_count
FROM (
  SELECT c.company_name, t.aircraft_type, 
         COUNT(*) as flight_count,
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY c.company_id ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) as rn
  FROM companies c
  JOIN trips t ON c.company_id = t.company_id
  GROUP BY c.company_id, c.company_name, t.aircraft_type
) ranked
WHERE rn = 1;
```

**Amanda Rodriguez:** That's a solid approach using window functions! However, there's one potential issue - what if two aircraft types have the same count for a company?

**Michael Thompson:** Oh, ROW_NUMBER would only pick one arbitrarily. I could use RANK() instead to show ties, but then I'd need to handle multiple rows per company...

**Amanda Rodriguez:** Exactly. These are the kinds of edge cases we deal with regularly. How comfortable are you with more advanced SQL concepts like CTEs, recursive queries, or optimization for large datasets?

**Michael Thompson:** I'm familiar with CTEs conceptually and have used them in practice a few times. Recursive queries and performance optimization are areas where I definitely need more experience. I've mostly worked with relatively small datasets.

## Attribution Logic Discussion

**David Martinez:** Let's shift to a marketing attribution scenario. We have Google Analytics data showing user sessions and separate order data. How would you approach building last-click attribution, but with the rule that if a promo code from an influencer was used, we attribute to that influencer instead?

**Michael Thompson:** I'd need to join the sessions to orders by user ID and timestamp, get the last session before each order, but then override with the promo code attribution if present.

Something like:
1. Get all orders with their timestamps
2. For each order, find the latest session before that order
3. If the order has a promo code, use that attribution instead of the session source

**Amanda Rodriguez:** That's the right logic. Can you sketch out the SQL structure for step 2 - finding the latest session before each order?

**Michael Thompson:** I think I'd use a window function...

```sql
WITH order_sessions AS (
  SELECT o.order_id, o.user_id, o.order_time,
         s.session_id, s.session_time, s.source,
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY o.order_id ORDER BY s.session_time DESC) as rn
  FROM orders o
  LEFT JOIN sessions s ON o.user_id = s.user_id 
                      AND s.session_time < o.order_time
)
SELECT order_id, session_id, source
FROM order_sessions 
WHERE rn = 1;
```

**David Martinez:** Good structure. One optimization question - this could be slow with large datasets. Any ideas how to improve performance?

**Michael Thompson:** Um, maybe... add indexes on user_id and timestamps? I'm not sure about more advanced optimization techniques.

**Amanda Rodriguez:** That's a start. We also use techniques like pre-aggregating data and partitioning. These are things you'd learn on the job.

## Data Quality & Problem Solving

**David Martinez:** Last scenario. You're setting up a dashboard and notice that conversion rates suddenly dropped 50% yesterday, but ad spend stayed the same. How would you investigate this?

**Michael Thompson:** I'd start by checking if there are data quality issues:
1. Are all data sources still connecting properly?
2. Did the tracking code break on the website?
3. Are there any unusual patterns in the data that might indicate duplicate removal or missing data?
4. Check if the definition of conversions changed
5. Look for any external factors like site downtime

**Amanda Rodriguez:** Good systematic approach. What SQL queries might you run to check for data quality issues?

**Michael Thompson:** I'd compare row counts day-over-day, check for null values in key fields, maybe look at unique user counts to see if tracking is working...

```sql
-- Check daily row counts
SELECT DATE(event_time) as date, COUNT(*) as events
FROM events 
WHERE event_time >= CURRENT_DATE - 7
GROUP BY DATE(event_time)
ORDER BY date;

-- Check for missing values
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_rows,
       COUNT(user_id) as non_null_users,
       COUNT(session_id) as non_null_sessions
FROM events 
WHERE DATE(event_time) = CURRENT_DATE - 1;
```

**David Martinez:** Exactly the kind of queries we'd run. Your debugging approach is sound.

## Wrap-up

**Amanda Rodriguez:** Thanks Michael. Overall, your SQL fundamentals are solid, and your problem-solving approach is good. The main areas for growth would be performance optimization and handling complex edge cases.

**Michael Thompson:** I appreciate the feedback. These scenarios are more complex than what I work with daily, but I can see the patterns. I'm excited about the opportunity to learn these advanced techniques.

**David Martinez:** We'll discuss internally and get back to you soon. Thanks for your time!
