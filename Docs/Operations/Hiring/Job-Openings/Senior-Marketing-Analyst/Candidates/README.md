# Candidate File Structure

Each candidate folder should follow this structure:

```
Candidate-[Name]/
├── CV.md                         # Candidate's resume/CV
├── Fathom-Screening-Interview.md # Notes from initial screening interview
├── Fathom-Technical-Interview.md # Notes from technical interview
├── AI-Notes.md                   # AI-generated analysis and insights
├── Screening-Evaluation.md       # Evaluation from screening stage
├── Evaluation.md                 # Comprehensive evaluation
└── Final-Score.md                # Final scoring and decision
```

## Creating a New Candidate Folder

To create a new candidate folder with the correct structure:

1. Copy the Template folder
2. Rename it to `Candidate-[Name]` (e.g., `Candidate-Jane-Smith`)
3. Fill in the relevant information in each file

## File Descriptions

- **CV.md**: Contains the candidate's resume information
- **Fathom-Screening-Interview.md**: Summary and notes from the initial screening interview
- **Fathom-Technical-Interview.md**: Detailed notes from the technical assessment interview
- **AI-Notes.md**: Automated analysis of the candidate's materials
- **Screening-Evaluation.md**: Evaluation form completed after the screening interview
- **Evaluation.md**: Comprehensive evaluation form with detailed scoring
- **Final-Score.md**: Final decision document with overall scores and hiring recommendation

## Template Usage

The Template folder contains blank versions of all required files with the correct structure. Use these as a starting point for each new candidate.
