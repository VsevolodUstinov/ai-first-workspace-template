- Data input to these files done manually after receipt from candidate
- Automated candidate evaluation triggers only after manual data completion

## Expectation-Role Alignment Assessment

### For Technical Roles
Throughout all selection stages, assess alignment between candidate expectations and actual job responsibilities:
- Special attention to balance of technical vs. business tasks in specific role
- Clear communication of implementation vs. strategy proportion in work
- Analysis of candidate's career trajectory for movement from technical to business roles
- Assessment of personal motivations and interests

### Potential Misalignment Indicators
The following signs require additional attention and candidate discussion:
- Career history shows consistent movement from technical to more strategic roles
- Candidate shows heightened interest in business processes and strategy when role is primarily technical
- Achievement descriptions emphasize business results over technical aspects
- Frequent mentions of desire to influence product decisions
- Emphasis on wanting to create new features/capabilities vs. implementing existing requirements
- Leadership and management tendencies in individual contributor role

### Actions When Misalignment Identified
1. Conduct detailed discussion with candidate about actual job content
2. Document identified misalignments in candidate evaluation
3. Include discussion of these aspects in subsequent interview stages
4. For significant misalignments, consider recommending candidate for other company roles
5. Final candidate evaluation must include analysis of expectation-reality alignment
