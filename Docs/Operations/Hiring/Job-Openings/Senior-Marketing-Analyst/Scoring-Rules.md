# Scoring Rules — Senior Marketing Analytics (Data Engineering Profile)

## Competency Thresholds:

## Salary Rule:

- For this role, the acceptable salary range is: $2500 — $4000 gross per month.**
- If candidate salary expectations are above the maximum budget — mark as "Salary Misalignment" and flag for human review.

## Overall Scoring Logic:

- **Strong Fit:** 80% or more of competencies meet or exceed threshold AND all critical skills (SQL, ETL, API) at required level AND salary within budget.
- **Potential Fit:** 60–80% meet threshold, minor non-critical gaps, salary acceptable.
- **Weak Fit:** Less than 60% meet threshold, OR any critical skill below threshold, OR salary outside budget.

## Notes:

- Russian Language remains a hard requirement.
- Insufficient data → mark clearly.
- Always explain any red flags.
