# Marketing Overview Video Script - Elly Analytics

*Source: Internal marketing content | Saved: May 2025*

**Note: This script describes our foundational marketing data platform and the six core problems it solves. We are now building AI performance marketing automation powered by this data platform foundation.**

## 01. Intro
Elly is a full-funnel marketing analytics platform made for ad-driven businesses. Created by marketers with over 10 years of experience, Elly was built to answer the question: "How can we get more from our marketing investments?" In this short video, we'll show you how Elly can help you do exactly that.

## 02. Example
Let's look at an example.

Our total ad budget is $30,000, split across three campaigns. We put most of our budget into the Lead Ads campaign because it brings in 175 leads at $97 each.

But what if we look at qualified leads?

We'd find that the Lookalike campaign actually costs less per qualified lead. We shouldn't stop there, though.

If we also consider the revenue each campaign brings in from customers, the Search campaign turns out to be the most profitable.

What if we adjust our budget based on these insights?

We could make an extra $50,000 from the same budget.

Sounds great, right? So why doesn't everyone use this kind of analytics to make more money? Well, it's not that simple. There are a few challenges on the way to full-funnel analytics.

## 03. Challenge #1: Siloed Data
Most successful businesses use several channels and a variety of tools to acquire and retain customers: search ads, paid social, display ads, influencer marketing, emails, chats, calls, and more. Each platform has its own reports, and the data is scattered across all of them.

Elly brings together all this data from ad platforms, web and app analytics platforms, marketing automation tools, and combines it with data from your CRM, even if it's custom.

With Elly, you don't need to worry about data streaming or organizing a data warehouse – it's already taken care of for you.

Elly then turns your data into insights, shown through customizable dashboards and detailed reports tailored to your business goals and your team's needs.

## 04. Challenge #2: Multi-browser, multi-device customer journey
Another challenge is that not all customers buy right after clicking an ad. Some need more time and touchpoints before they're ready to buy. But tools like Google Analytics treat visits from different devices and browsers as separate 'users', messing up your customer journey map.

By utilizing your first-party customer data, such as phone numbers and email addresses, Elly compiles a complete interaction history in the customer's profile across all browsers and devices where they've identified themselves at least once.

Customer profiles in Elly Analytics not only ensure accurate attribution, but you can also view these profiles in a dedicated report to better understand your customers' journeys.

## 05. Challenge #3: Attribution
Full-funnel analytics isn't helpful if most of your leads are attributed to Direct, Email, Organic, or Branded Search campaigns. While these are often the final visits before conversion, they can't be scaled. Simple 'last-click' attribution underestimates paid channels, non-brand campaigns, and influencer marketing due to tracking issues, leading to lower returns and missed revenue from effective marketing efforts.

By mapping the entire customer journey and using advanced attribution tailored to your business, Elly significantly improves the accuracy of attribution.

With Elly Analytics, you can use several attribution models, all customized to your business, and switch between them in reports to get a full view of your marketing performance.

## 06. Challenge #4: Delayed data on results
Another challenge is when sales happen much later than the initial click, or there's a long tail of recurring revenue, like in subscription-based businesses or those with lots of repeat purchases. In these cases, it's tough to tell right away if your ads are profitable, making it hard to optimize your campaigns.

To solve this, Elly uses historical data to forecast the value of every new lead. This information shows up in your dashboards and reports, so you don't have to wait weeks or months to see how well your new ads are performing.

In Elly Analytics, you can forecast revenue, LTV, and even margins.

## 07. Challenge #5: Manual ad optimization
Even when you have all the data, manually optimizing campaigns is a lot of work. The good news is that ad platforms have optimization algorithms that can do this for you. Just remember, they work best when they get results shortly after the ad click.

Elly can send leads with a good revenue forecast back to ad platforms as conversions. This helps train their algorithms to optimize ads for leads with the highest potential value.

We call this feature 'Autopilot' because it lets you move from manually managing budgets and bids to letting the ad platforms handle it.

## 08. Challenge #6: Complexity
After hearing about all these complications and challenges, you might think that full-funnel analytics is too much to handle. But with Elly Analytics, it's simple. Just add one line of code to your website and grant Elly access to your data sources. Elly's team of marketing data engineers and analysts takes care of the rest. They handle data collection and integration and ensure that your dashboards are accurate for decision-making.

After setup, Elly's team continues to offer support and advice through regular check-in calls.

## 09. Summary
Let's wrap things up. If you want to scale your marketing efficiently to make more money, you need to see the whole picture, from ads to lifetime revenue. But getting that full-funnel analytics can be challenging. The good news is that Elly Analytics handles all these challenges for you:

- Brings all your data together in one place, giving you a single source of truth with actionable dashboards.
