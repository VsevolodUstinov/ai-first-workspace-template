**Key Insight:** Birch validates the market demand for ad automation, but their e-commerce focus and rule-based approach leave room for Elly to differentiate through lead-based business specialization, attribution-powered AI, and natural language interfaces.

**Competitive Positioning:** Elly can position as "attribution-powered AI automation" vs Birch's "rule-based ad automation" - targeting the gap between data analytics and campaign execution.
