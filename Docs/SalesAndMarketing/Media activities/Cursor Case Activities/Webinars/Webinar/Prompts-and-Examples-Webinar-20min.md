# Cursor as your personal super-agent — 20‑minute webinar

> Purpose: Script for Seva's webinar at Kumar Solo — Aug 20, 2025

## Preparation checklist

* Zoom session
* Share entire laptop screen
* Clean up desktop/windows
* Open a dedicated browser window with: Cursor.com (logged out), screenshots from Open Folder, WisprFlow, [GitHub SuperAgent](), EllyAnalytics.com, Power BI dashboard/report, AGI.EllyAnalytics.com, Telegram channel screenshot, course announcement
* Open Cursor on SuperAgent Ru and pull updates
* Choose model Sonnet 4

## Agenda (blocks)

## 1) Intro — ChatGPT is last‑gen (1 min)

* Everyone uses ChatGPT: long threads, context lost between sessions, copy/paste back and forth; answers questions, does one‑step tasks
* Super‑agent knows the whole context and solves tasks, not just replies

### 2) Live demo “Why better than ChatGPT” + interface walkthrough

## 🎯 DEMO 1: Competitor analysis (5 min)

Exact prompt from transcript:

> “A new competitor popped up, Icon.ai or icon.com, a service that generates ad creatives. Do a full analysis using our workflow and put it in the right folder.”

While it runs, explain what’s happening:

* Comment what the chat is doing
* Workflow is described in Cursor rules (open, show, add context about rules)
* Show the result file
* Bonus: update the Competitor Landscape summary
* Bonus 2: update the competitor block in executive summary
* Bonus 3: update cursor rules to check Reddit reviews separately

## 🎯 DEMO 2: Team calls analysis — step by step (5 min)

### Step 1: Take transcript and extract via template

Prompt:

> “Take the sales call transcript and extract a client card with key info using our template.”

What we show:

* Before: had to listen to calls, prepare summaries via template
* Extracts only the needed bits from a big multi‑client call
* Uses our templates to produce a structured card

### Step 2: Create summaries for different targets

Prompt:

> “Now create two files: a short summary for Slack and a long one for Notion.”

Emphasis:

* Before: notes kept in a notetaker → then GPT by template → then pasted into many docs
* Now: done inside Cursor, saved and reusable later
* Updates everything: client cards, presales, project status, checklists and tasks

### Step 3: Send to Notion

Prompt:

> “Send the result to our Notion workspace.”

### 🔥 Key value — what next:

Add three short examples:

Prompt 1:

> “From the last 3 months of meetings, extract the most repeated client questions about our tool.”

Prompt 2:

> “Extract all client mentions of Elly from all transcripts — positive highlights and what clients noticed after using Elly.”

Prompt 3:

> “Find all competitor mentions or comparisons and what clients said.”

Next step: “Then all of this gets automated — it goes to Fireflies, fetches meetings and processes them automatically.”

## 🚀 Getting started (tabs, screenshots, github, rules) (2 min)

## Roma asks the chat what people asked ChatGPT last

## 💬 Interactive with Roma (5 min)

### Most impactful scenario (2 min)

Most impactful: We moved our entire knowledge base into Cursor and I can ask how something works — it searches docs, reads code, explains — “how does the retry policy for Google Ads work?”

My first one: “Read company/product/vision/ICP and build me a new offer template for a client.”

* Theoretically I could do this with ChatGPT, but there I don’t control context. If the dialog drifted, I can’t recover it. If it went well but context ended — it forgets. Here the context is saved, used, updated.
* A new paradigm of working with the computer — like with an assistant that performs tasks

### About hallucinations → cursor rules (1 min)

### About duplicate files → cursor rules (1 min)

### When unclear → ask the agent to web‑search (1 min)

* Which models to use? How do cursor rules work? How to connect Google Drive?

### When it does something dumb → ask the agent how others solve it in practice

### Roma asks “What are you building at Elly right now?” (2 min)

* Agent — “Analyze project metrics and suggest improvements”, “Create a rule to scale/pause ads”
* Alpha — if you need analytics or want pilot access — DM us

## Follow the updates (channel screenshot)

## 🎬 Wrap‑up: what we covered today, try it yourself, masterclass in the course (3 min)

## About the course

Structure:

* 1 session on Cursor: “Advanced lesson on agent creation, masterclass of top scripts for marketers (1.5–2 hours)”
* 2 sessions on analytics: “What modern marketing analytics should look like?”
  * Management part (funnel workshop)
  * Technical part (pitfalls and how to avoid them)

## 🎯 Extra prompts

1. “Create a Slack and a Notion summary”
2. “Send the result to Notion”
3. “Visit ellyanalytics.com, go to testimonials/cases page. Which ones fit a finance industry deck?”
4. “Review sessions with odd utm tags and reassign to correct sources”
5. …
6. …

## Other tricks

1. Script creation
2. DB connections (via scripts)
3. MCP (scripts are still more reliable)
4. Open‑source use
5. “Vibe‑coding” your own tools
6. Generate landing pages/prototypes here like in Lovable
7. In any unclear situation — ask your Cursor. If it’s dumb — ask how others solved it.

You can also share company‑wide — separate talk and a template in GitHub.
