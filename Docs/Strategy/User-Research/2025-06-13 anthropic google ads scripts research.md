---

Performance marketers managing $50k+/month in ad spend frequently resort to custom Google Ads scripts because **native automation fails to address sophisticated business logic, external data integration, and granular control requirements**. This research reveals specific automation pain points so significant that advertisers choose complex custom development over built-in features, presenting clear opportunities for a "Cursor for performance marketers" tool.

## The core automation gap driving script adoption

Google Ads Scripts serve as a critical bridge where native platform capabilities fall short of enterprise needs. While **63% of advertisers use only 1-5 scripts** despite Google allowing 250 per account, high-spend advertisers in SaaS, lead-gen, and ecommerce consistently push beyond these limits due to **fundamental limitations in native automation** that prevent sophisticated campaign management.

The most telling finding: advertisers choose the complexity of JavaScript development and 30-minute execution limits over Google's "black box" Smart Bidding specifically because they need **transparency, control, and business-specific decision logic** that native features cannot provide.

## Most common script use cases among high-spend advertisers

**Tier 1: Essential automations (universally adopted):**
- **Budget monitoring and overspend prevention** - Critical due to Google's 2x daily budget overdelivery capability
- **Performance Max transparency tools** - PMax campaigns are "black boxes" requiring custom monitoring for search term visibility and brand traffic analysis
- **Quality Score historical tracking** - Google doesn't store historical QS data, forcing advertisers to build custom tracking systems
- **Account anomaly detection** - Multi-metric monitoring across 20+ KPIs with statistical deviation analysis
- **Cross-account management via MCC scripts** - Bulk operations across hundreds of campaigns impossible through native interface

**Tier 2: Performance enhancement automations:**
- **Weather-based bidding** integrated with OpenWeatherMap API for contextual optimization
- **N-gram analysis** for search query mining and negative keyword automation across millions of queries  
- **Advanced bid management** with external data integration (inventory, competitor pricing, CRM data)
- **Custom attribution modeling** beyond Google's default last-click attribution
- **Automated A/B testing orchestration** across multiple campaign variables

**Tier 3: Enterprise integration automations:**
- **CRM-connected lead scoring** with real-time bid adjustments based on qualification probability
- **Inventory-based bidding** preventing ad spend on out-of-stock products
- **Cross-platform reporting consolidation** combining Google Ads, Analytics, and CRM data
- **Competitive intelligence integration** with automated response to market changes

## Specific automation needs native features cannot address

**Granular control limitations:**
