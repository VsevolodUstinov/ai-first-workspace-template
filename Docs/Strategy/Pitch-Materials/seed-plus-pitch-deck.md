## 2  Where [TARGET_USERS] Lose Their Week  *(visual pie / donut chart)*

Design reference for LLM/designer:
```
Pie slices (realistic example – refine with user studies):

[X]%  [PAIN_POINT_1]     – [SPECIFIC_ACTIVITIES_DESCRIPTION]
[X]%  [PAIN_POINT_2]     – [SPECIFIC_ACTIVITIES_DESCRIPTION]
[X]%  [PAIN_POINT_3]     – [SPECIFIC_ACTIVITIES_DESCRIPTION]
[X]%  [PAIN_POINT_4]     – [SPECIFIC_ACTIVITIES_DESCRIPTION]
[X]%  [PAIN_POINT_5]     – [SPECIFIC_ACTIVITIES_DESCRIPTION]
[X]%  [HIGH_VALUE_WORK]  – [STRATEGIC_ACTIVITIES] (**highlight in green** – the work they *want* to do).

→ Designer note: add small call-out arrow on the green slice with text: *[ROADMAP_FEATURE] will [IMPACT_DESCRIPTION]*.
```

Key labels/overlays:
• Shade first five slices in one color family and place a bold overlay: **"[X]% [BUSY_WORK_DESCRIPTION]."**  
• Highlight the small [X]% slice in green with label **"[VALUE_WORK_LABEL]"** to show what [COMPANY_NAME] gives back.  
• Footnote or side call-out: *$[X]B [MARKET_SPEND] → [X]-[Y]% wasted due to [ROOT_CAUSE_1] & [ROOT_CAUSE_2].*

Source/context note (small text under chart): *Typical weekly time split for [TARGET_ROLE] at [TARGET_BUSINESS_TYPE] spending $[X]k–[Y]k/mo on [ACTIVITY] (n=[X] interviews).*  

Speaker note (optional):
"[PAIN_POINT_SUMMARY]. That's why we begin with [FOUNDATION_SOLUTION] ([PRODUCT_V1]) and then automate the rest ([PRODUCT_V2])."

## 4  Our Insight
• **[CORE_INSIGHT_1]** for meaningful [AUTOMATION_CATEGORY].  
• [TARGET_MARKET] have [COMPLEXITY_DESCRIPTION] but [TOOLING_GAP].  
• [CURRENT_LIMITATION] — [SYSTEMS] need [DATA_REQUIREMENT] to [OPTIMIZE_GOAL] — [TARGET_CUSTOMERS] that [SOLUTION_ADOPTION] win.  
• **[TECHNOLOGY_BREAKTHROUGH]** — for the first time [USER_TYPE] can [NEW_CAPABILITY], creating a short window to define this new [INTERFACE_STANDARD].
• Market moving from *[OLD_PARADIGM]* to **[NEW_PARADIGM]** — value defined by [VALUE_METRIC], not [OLD_METRIC]. Our first [USE_CASE] already delivers that outcome.

## 5  Solution Overview
• **[PRODUCT_V1]** – [PRODUCT_DESCRIPTION] ([CORE_FEATURES]).  
• **[PRODUCT_V2]** – [AI_LAYER_DESCRIPTION]: [INPUT_METHOD] → [PROCESSING] → [OUTPUT_ACTIONS].  
• Unified platform spanning [X] core use-cases: [USE_CASE_1] • [USE_CASE_2] • [USE_CASE_3] • [USE_CASE_4] • [USE_CASE_5].

## 6  Product Demo (split visual)
• **Left panel ([FOUNDATION_COMPONENT]):** screenshot / mock of [DASHBOARD_TYPE]—[METRIC_1] by [DIMENSION], [METRIC_2], [FEATURE_SELECTOR]. Caption: *[PRODUCT_V1] – the [DATA_DESCRIPTION] everyone trusts.*  
• **Right panel ([AI_COMPONENT]):** screen capture of [PRODUCT_V2] [INTERFACE] issuing [COMMAND_TYPE]: "[EXAMPLE_COMMAND]." Shows [PREVIEW_TYPE] + [APPROVAL_MECHANISM]. Caption: *[PRODUCT_V2] – [INTERFACE_DESCRIPTION] powered by that data.*  

// Connecting arrow/text in the middle: "[V1] feeds [V2]" – same dataset drives both [INSIGHTS] and [ACTIONS]

---

## 7  Market Opportunity  *(stats + trend call-outs)*  
• **[MARKET_CATEGORY] keeps surging:** $[X]B ([YEAR]) → **$[Y]B by [FUTURE_YEAR]** ([SOURCE] forecast)[^1].  
• **[COST_METRIC] inflation:** [COST_DESCRIPTION] up **[X]% in the last decade** ([SOURCE] study, [YEAR])[^2].  
• **[SOLUTION_CATEGORY] TAM grows fast:** $[X]B ([YEAR]) → **$[Y]B by [FUTURE_YEAR]** – [X]% CAGR ([SOURCE])[^3].  
• [TARGET_SEGMENT] are [MARKET_POSITION] ([SPEND_AMOUNT] spend) and feel [PRESSURE_TYPE] most; [SOLUTION_TYPE] is now "must-have," not "nice-to-have."  
• Paradigm shift: [TECHNOLOGY_TREND] make [OLD_APPROACH] → [NEW_REALITY] → only teams with [ADVANTAGE_1] + [ADVANTAGE_2] will win (enter **[COMPANY_NAME]**).
