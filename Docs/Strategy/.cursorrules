# [COMPANY_NAME] Strategy Repository - Template Rules

## Repository Overview
This is the strategy repository within the [COMPANY_NAME] workspace - containing comprehensive strategic planning, competitive intelligence, and strategic decision-making documentation. This serves as the strategic brain of the organization.

**Treat this as architectural documentation for building [COMPANY_NAME]** - every piece of information, analysis, and strategic decision must flow from authoritative sources through a clear hierarchy. This is not a collection of business descriptions, but a precise technical blueprint where strategic decisions are documented with the same rigor as software architecture.

## Project Structure
The strategy repository contains clean, factual documentation across core strategic areas:

```
strategy/ (this repository)
├── Company-Overview/        # Mission, vision, values, company foundation
├── Product/                 # Product specs, features, use cases  
├── Business-Model/          # Pricing, unit economics, revenue model
├── Team/                    # Founders, team structure, advisors, culture

# PROCEDURAL RULES

## Information Architecture & Duplication Prevention

### Core Principle
Treat this specification as the blueprint for building [COMPANY_NAME] - eliminate ambiguities, unnecessary duplicates, inconsistencies, and unclear sources while maintaining high "thought density."

### 1. Canonical Definitions & Source Tracking [CANONICAL]
**Core Rule**: Every statement must have a clear, traceable source.

**Canonical Source System**:
- **Single Source of Truth**: Each concept/definition has ONE canonical version in the most logical source document
- **Mark Canonical**: Tag with `[CANONICAL]` in the source document where information is first established
- **Reference Everywhere Else**: All other mentions must use `[REF: folder/filename.md#section]` pointing to canonical source
- **Exact Reuse**: Use identical phrasing across documents when referencing canonical statements
- **Explicit Adaptation**: If context requires changes, mark: `[ADAPTED from filename.md: "original" → "adapted"]`

**Source Tracking Requirements**:
- **No Orphan Statements**: Every claim, metric, or strategic assertion must be traceable to its origin
- **Clear Attribution**: Mark where information came from: team confirmation, external research, calculations, etc.
- **Update Propagation**: When changing canonical version, search and update all `[REF:]` references
- **Searchable References**: Use consistent `[REF:]` format to enable finding all dependencies

**Example Implementation**:
```
// In Team/team-overview.md:
**Total Headcount**: [X] people (as of [DATE]) [CANONICAL]

// In other files:
Team size of [X] people [REF: Team/team-overview.md#current-team-size]
Current [X]-person team [REF: Team/team-overview.md#current-team-size]
```

**Update Workflow**:
1. Change canonical version: `[X] people → [Y] people [CANONICAL]`
2. Search repository for: `[REF: Team/team-overview.md#current-team-size]`
3. Update all found references to reflect new canonical information
4. Verify consistency across all documents

### 2. Reference Architecture
- **Format**: `[REF: folder/filename.md#section]` for searchable cross-references
- **Dependency Hierarchy**: 
  ```
  Source Documents (Company-Overview through Business-Model folders)
  ↓
  Analysis (Competitors/)
  ↓
  Summaries (competitive-landscape-summary.md)
  ↓
  Executive Overview (executive-summary.md)
  ↓
  Pitch Materials (derived only, no original content)
  ```
- **Update Propagation**: Check dependency chain when updating, suggest options if unclear

### 3. Strategic Repetition Rules
- **With Source**: Only repeat when adding value, always include `[REF: source]`
- **Unique Angle**: Mark explicitly: `[UNIQUE ANGLE: context/perspective]`
- **High Thought Density**: Every repeated element must add significant value
- **No Within-Document Duplication**: Avoid repeating same content in single document

### 4. Data Accuracy & Source Tracking
- **[CANONICAL]**: The authoritative definition/data point in the knowledge base
- **[CONFIRMED: source]**: Information directly provided by team
- **[PLACEHOLDER: owner]**: Information to be filled with clear ownership
- **[REF: folder/filename.md#section]**: Cross-references for searchability

### 5. Historical Document Protection
- **DO NOT EDIT**: Published investor updates, press releases, legal documents
- **Preserve Exactly**: Historical financials and sent communications
- **Create New Versions**: With clear date labels for updates

## Strategic Positioning Rules

### Market Focus [CANONICAL]
- **Primary Target**: [TARGET_MARKET] businesses spending >[THRESHOLD]/month on [PRIMARY_EXPENSE]
- **Sweet Spot**: $[MIN]-[MAX]/month [SPEND_CATEGORY] companies seeking [VALUE_PROPOSITION] vs [ALTERNATIVE_PRICING_MODEL]
- **Market Gap**: [TARGET_MARKET] businesses underserved by [COMPETITOR_FOCUS]-focused [CATEGORY] platforms
- **Geographic Scope**: Primary focus [REGION_1] ([X]% of revenue), secondary markets in [REGION_2], select clients globally
- **Core Differentiation**: [EXPERTISE_1] + [INNOVATION] ("[ANALOGY]") vs competitors' [LIMITATION] solutions
- **Technology Position**: [INTERFACE_TYPE] for [USE_CASE] vs [COMPETITOR_APPROACH]

### Competitive Messaging [REF: Competitors/competitive-landscape-summary.md#competitive-messaging]

#### [PRODUCT_V1] Competition ([CATEGORY_1]) [REF: Competitors/competitive-landscape-summary.md#product-v1-competition]
- **vs [CATEGORY_1] Platforms** ([COMPETITOR_A], [COMPETITOR_B]): [SPECIALIZATION] + [ADVANTAGE_1] + [ADVANTAGE_2]
- **vs [CATEGORY_2] Tools** ([COMPETITOR_C], [COMPETITOR_D]): [FEATURE_1] + [FEATURE_2] + [INTEGRATION_DEPTH]
- **vs [CATEGORY_3] Platforms**: [FOCUS_AREA] vs [COMPETITOR_FOCUS]

#### [PRODUCT_V2] Competition ([CATEGORY_2]) [REF: Competitors/competitive-landscape-summary.md#product-v2-competition]
- **vs [AUTOMATION_TYPE] Platforms** ([COMPETITOR_E], [COMPETITOR_F]): "[VISION_PHRASE]" [INTERFACE] across [X] core use cases vs [COMPETITOR_LIMITATION], [SCOPE] vs [COMPETITOR_SCOPE], [DATA_ADVANTAGE] vs [COMPETITOR_DATA_LIMITATION]
- **Key Differentiators**: [FOUNDATION], [COVERAGE], "[ANALOGY]" [INTERFACE] vs [COMPETITOR_INTERFACE]
- **Competitive Advantage**: Only [COMPREHENSIVE_SOLUTION] built on [EXPERTISE] and [DATA_DEPTH]

#### Combined Positioning [REF: Competitors/competitive-landscape-summary.md#combined-positioning]
- **Unique Advantage**: Only platform combining [EXPERTISE] with [COMPREHENSIVE_SOLUTION] across [X] core use cases
- **Data Foundation**: [AUTOMATION] built on [DATA_TYPE], not just [COMPETITOR_DATA_TYPE]
- **Market Gap**: [TARGET_MARKET] underserved by [COMPETITOR_FOCUS_1] and [FRAGMENTATION_ISSUE]
- **Vision Advantage**: "[VISION_PHRASE]" - transform [INDUSTRY] from [CURRENT_STATE] to [FUTURE_STATE]

## Competitor Analysis Process [CANONICAL]

**Deep Research Required**: When user requests competitor analysis, conduct comprehensive research across multiple sources. Key areas to research: product pages, pricing pages, founder backgrounds, press releases, funding announcements, G2/Capterra reviews, case studies, use cases, performance claims, customer testimonials, and strategic partnerships. Use web search for funding rounds, founder LinkedIn profiles, industry coverage, and competitor comparisons.

**Process**:
1. **Research**: Conduct comprehensive research per requirements above
2. **Create**: `[company-name]-analysis.md` using 11-section template (Company Overview → Bottom Line)
3. **Classify**: [CATEGORY_1] ([EXAMPLE_A]) | [CATEGORY_2] ([EXAMPLE_B]) | [CATEGORY_3] ([EXAMPLE_C])
4. **Update Summary**: Update `competitive-landscape-summary.md` with cross-references

## Common Use Cases
