# B2B SaaS Pricing Model Template
*[TEMPLATE EXAMPLE - Feature-based pricing strategy framework for complex B2B SaaS products]*

## �� Pricing Philosophy [CANONICAL]

**Core Principle**: Price based on features and complexity, NOT on client size or growth

**What DOESN'T affect pricing:**
- ❌ [PRIMARY_USAGE_METRIC] size ($[X]k vs $[Y]k/month)
- ❌ [BUSINESS_OUTCOME] volume ($[X]M vs $[Y]M annually) 
- ❌ [DATA_VOLUME] (within standard limits)
- ❌ Business growth over time

**What DOES affect pricing:**
- ✅ Features and integrations selected
- ✅ [DATA_SOURCES] complexity  
- ✅ Number of [EVENT_TYPES] in data model
- ✅ [CORE_COMPLEXITY] (multiple objects)
- ✅ Volume threshold: >[X]k [SESSIONS/UNITS] per day (+50% markup)

**Client Impact:** [CANONICAL]
- **Small Clients**: Higher initial investment ($[X]-[Y]k/month) but predictable costs
- **Large Clients**: Love predictable pricing - no cost increases as they scale
- **Enterprise Advantage**: Exceptional value compared to percentage-based competitors
