## Analysis Instructions

Your task is to analyze the meeting transcript between our sales team and a potential client, and create a detailed structured summary for internal team use.

**Important Principles:**
1. **Focus on client, not us** - 80% of content should describe client's business, problems, and context
2. **Maximum detail** - include all mentioned numbers, tool names, people names, specific cases
3. **Objectivity** - don't embellish or interpret, only facts from conversation
4. **Structure** - use clear sections with emojis for easy reading
5. **Context**: All meetings are with leads - anyone except our sales team is the prospect
6. **Client Business**: If unclear what client does, check meeting title (usually "Client Company + Our Company")
