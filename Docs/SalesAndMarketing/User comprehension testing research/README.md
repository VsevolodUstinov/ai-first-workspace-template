# User Comprehension Testing for Landing Page

## Simplified Structure

We now have **only two files** for the entire process:

1. **`corridor-test-questions.md`** - complete list of questions (for copying to note-taker)
2. **`corridor-test-analysis-template.md`** - analysis template with quick checklist + full analysis

## Folder Structure

Each test is saved in a separate file with the name format:

```
corridor-test-analysis-[NAME]-[DATE].md
```

Example: `corridor-test-analysis-john-smith-2025-01-15.md`
