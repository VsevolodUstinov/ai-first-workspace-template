# Final Candidate Score - John Doe

> **NOTE: This document represents the FINAL hiring decision based on complete candidate assessment.**

## Technical Competency: 6/10
Strong SQL (4/5) and ETL (4/5) skills, but critical deficiency in API Integration (1/5) is concerning for our tech stack. Data visualization skills (3/5) are adequate but not exceptional. Technical foundation is strong in some areas but has significant gaps in required competencies.

## Experience Relevance: 7/10
Extensive marketing analytics experience across diverse industries, with particular strength in campaign analysis (5/5). Background in Applied Mathematics provides solid analytical foundation, but appears to lack experience with modern marketing integration technologies.

## Cultural Fit: 5/10
Communication skills appear strong (5/5), but red flags in teamwork (2/5) and problem-solving (2/5) indicate potential issues working in our collaborative environment. Limited documentation experience suggests potential gaps in our knowledge-sharing culture.

## Communication Skills: 7/10
Strong communication capabilities (5/5) but may be undermined by weak teamwork ratings. B2 English level is sufficient but not exceptional for client-facing work. Technical communication abilities need further verification.

## Overall Score: 6.25/10

## Final Hiring Decision
- [ ] Extend Offer
- [ ] Keep in Talent Pool
- [X] Reject

## Decision Maker
Yulia Kuzmane, Head of Operations

## Decision Date
June 12, 2025

## Primary Rejection Reason
**Career Misalignment**: During the interview process, it became clear that John Doe is primarily interested in business-oriented positions rather than technical roles. His career aspirations are directed toward management and business strategy, which do not align with this technical Senior Marketing Analyst position that requires deep engagement with data integration, API development, and technical implementation.

### Key Quotations Demonstrating Misalignment:

> "I see myself moving into a more strategic role in the next 2-3 years, ideally heading a marketing department where I can make high-level business decisions rather than focusing on the technical implementation." - When asked about career goals

> "While I can certainly handle the technical aspects, what really excites me is translating data into business strategy and managing cross-functional teams." - When discussing day-to-day responsibilities

> "I'm less interested in building the data pipelines myself and more focused on the insights we can derive for business strategy." - When asked about API integration experience

> "My ideal next step would be a role that positions me to move into marketing management. I'm looking to transition away from the purely technical side of analytics." - When discussing why he's interested in this position

These statements clearly indicate a preference for business strategy and management over the technical implementation that is central to this role.

## Additional Considerations
* Technical gaps in API integration capabilities
* Concerns about teamwork and collaboration in a technical environment
* Limited interest in the deeper technical aspects of the role

*While John has strong marketing domain knowledge and some technical skills, his career interests are fundamentally misaligned with this technical role. We recommend considering him for more business-oriented positions in the future if they become available, but he is not suitable for this technically focused Senior Marketing Analyst position.*
