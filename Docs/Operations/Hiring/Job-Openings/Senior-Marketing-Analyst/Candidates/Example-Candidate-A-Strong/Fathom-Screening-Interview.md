## Company Introduction & Role Overview

**Emily Roberts:** Hi Sarah! Thank you for joining us today. I'd like to start by giving you an overview of our company and the role we're discussing.

We're a marketing analytics consultancy working with mid-to-enterprise clients who spend $20K+ monthly on digital advertising. We provide subscription-based analytics services with a focus on long-term partnerships.

The analyst role is quite hands-on - you'd be involved from initial requirements gathering through implementation and ongoing optimization. About 80% of your time would be in SQL and data processing, with 20% in Power BI for visualization.

Does this align with what you were expecting from the role?

**Sarah Johnson:** Yes, absolutely. That actually sounds very similar to the structure I worked with at DataDriven Solutions.

## Technical Experience Deep Dive

**Emily Roberts:** Great! Can you walk me through your experience with marketing attribution modeling?

**Sarah Johnson:** Sure. At TechFlow, I built a multi-touch attribution model processing about 100 million touchpoints monthly across 12 digital channels. The result was a 22% budget reallocation that generated about $800K in incremental revenue.

**Emily Roberts:** How would you rate your SQL skills on a scale of 1-10?

**Sarah Johnson:** I'd say an 8. I'm very comfortable with complex joins, window functions, CTEs, and performance optimization. I've built data pipelines that process millions of records daily.

**Emily Roberts:** What about your experience with external client communication?

**Sarah Johnson:** I have significant client-facing experience from my agency days. I regularly presented to C-level executives and can adapt my communication style based on the audience's technical background.

## Motivation & Career Goals

**Emily Roberts:** What's driving your interest in making a move right now?

**Sarah Johnson:** I'm looking for a role where I can have more direct impact on business outcomes. I'm drawn to the consulting model because each client presents unique challenges.

**Emily Roberts:** Where do you see your career heading in the next 2-3 years?

**Sarah Johnson:** I'd like to become a subject matter expert in marketing analytics while developing stronger business acumen. Eventually, I could see myself leading a small team of analysts.

## Next Steps

**Emily Roberts:** Our next step would be a technical interview with our Lead Analyst. We'll send you a business case study to review beforehand.

**Sarah Johnson:** That sounds great. I'm excited to dive into a real business case.
