Looms Intro sections:

**"Video 1 Intro (30-45 seconds)"**:
"Hi, I'm Seva, founder and CEO of Elly Analytics - an AI-first marketing analytics platform for performance marketers.
I believe the future belongs to AI-first companies. That's why I chose a tool that completely transformed how I think about building a business and handling both personal and work tasks.
We're talking about Cursor - and yes, everyone thinks it's just for developers. They're wrong.
Let me show you one incredible example..."

**"Video 2 Intro (45-60 seconds):"**
"In the first video, I showed you the use case that won over my entire team - product, marketing, operations.
That was just the beginning.
Today I'm sharing more use cases, diving deeper into the technical details, and giving you everything you need to start using Cursor like a pro.
Because here's the thing - while everyone's still thinking Cursor is just a coding tool, smart leaders are already using it to 10x their entire business operations.
Ready to see how? Let's go..."


## Agenda (blocks)

## 1) Intro — ChatGPT is last‑gen (1 min)

- Everyone uses ChatGPT: long threads, context is lost between sessions, copy/paste back and forth; it just answers questions and does one‑step tasks
- A super‑agent knows the entire context and actually solves tasks

### 2) Live demo “Why better than ChatGPT” + interface walkthrough

## 🎯 DEMO 1: Competitor analysis (5 min)

Exact prompt from transcript:

> “A new competitor popped up, Icon.ai or icon.com, a service that generates ad creatives. Do a full analysis using our workflow and put it in the right folder.”

While it runs, explain what’s happening:

- Comment what the chat is doing
- The workflow is described in Cursor rules (open, show, add more context about rules)
- Show the result — the created file
- Bonus: update the Competitor Landscape summary
- Bonus 2: update the competitor block in executive summary
- Bonus 3: update cursor rules to check Reddit reviews separately

## 🎯 DEMO 2: Team calls analysis — step by step (5 min)

### Step 1: Take the transcript and process via template

Prompt:

> “Take the latest team call transcript from August and update project status cards.”

How it works:
- There’s a script that splits the team call into transcript + per‑project statuses
- There’s a template used to update a project status

### Step 2: Create a summary for different purposes

Prompt:

> “Create a file listing which projects are ready to finish implementation so marketing can collect testimonials.”

### Examples — what else to do for marketing:

- Extract repeated client questions from sales and client calls — build a knowledge base
- Gather positive highlights: what clients noticed about using Elly on calls
- Find all competitor mentions or comparisons on calls and what clients said

Next step: “This entire workflow can be automated.”

## 🚀 Getting started (tabs, screenshots, github, rules) (2 min)

## Roma asks the chat what people asked ChatGPT last

## 💬 Interactive with Roma (5 min)

### Most impactful scenario (2 min)

Most impactful: We moved our whole knowledge base into Cursor and I can ask how something works — it searches docs, reads code, explains — “how does the retry policy for Google Ads work?”

My first one: “Read company/product/vision/ICP — and build me a new offer template for a client.”

- Theoretically I could do this with ChatGPT, but there I don’t control context. If the dialog drifted — I can’t recover it. If it went well but the context ended — it forgets. Here the context is saved, used, and updated.
- A new paradigm of working with the computer — like with an assistant that performs tasks

### About hallucinations → cursor rules (1 min)

### About duplicate files → cursor rules (1 min)

### When unclear → ask the agent to web‑search (1 min)

- Which models to use? How do cursor rules work? How to connect Google Drive?

### When it does something dumb → ask the agent how others solve this task

### Roma asks “What are you working on at Elly?” (2 min)

- Agent — “Analyze project metrics and suggest improvements”, “Create a rule to scale/pause ads”
- Alpha — if you need analytics or want to join the pilot — DM us

## Follow the updates (channel screenshot)

## 🎬 Wrap‑up: what we covered today, try it yourself, masterclass in the course (3 min)

## About the course

Structure:

- 1 session on Cursor: “Advanced lesson on agent creation, masterclass of top scripts for marketers (1.5–2 hours)”
- 2 sessions on analytics: “What modern marketing analytics should look like?”
  - Management part (funnel workshop)
  - Technical part (pitfalls and how to avoid them)

## 🎯 Extra prompts

1. “Create a Slack and a Notion summary”
2. “Send the result to Notion”
3. “Visit ellyanalytics.com, go to testimonials/cases page — which ones can I use in a finance industry deck?”
4. “Review sessions with odd UTM tags and reassign to correct sources”
5. …
6. …

## Other tricks

1. You can create scripts
2. You can connect to DBs (via scripts)
3. You can use MCP (scripts are more reliable for now)
4. You can use open‑source
5. You can “vibe‑code” your own tools
6. You can generate landing pages and prototypes here like in Lovable
7. In any unclear situation — ask your Cursor. If it’s dumb — ask how others solved it in practice.

You can also share inside the company — separate talk and a template in GitHub
